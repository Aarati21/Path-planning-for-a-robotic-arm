# Path-planning-for-a-robotic-arm-
An effective planner for a planar arm to move from its start joint angles to the goal joint angles. It returns a plan that is collision-free and supports upto 7 degrees of freedom. 4 algorithms have been implemented.

(a) RRT 
(b) RRT-Connect 
(c) RRTâˆ— 
(d) PRM

For 20 randomly generated start and goal pairs on map2.txt, and for each of the four planners, you must provide a table reporting the comparison of:
(a) Average planning times 
(b) Average path qualities 
(c) Average number of vertices generated (in constructed graph/tree) 
(d) Success rates for generating solutions within 5 seconds
